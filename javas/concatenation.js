// concatenation example
let userName = "Ricky";
let age = 30;

let message = "My name is " + userName + " and I'm " + age +" years old."; //concat means bsically attach
// // let message2 = "My name is ${userName} and I'm `${age}` years old."; Not working like 
// that because it is string




// This is Template litrel

let message3 = `My name is ${userName} and I'm ${age} years old.`;

//console.log(`My name is ${userName} my age is ${age}`);
//console.log(message);
// console.log(message2);
console.log(message3);
